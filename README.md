# ProjectTwo
Fit-Link is a personal trainer/client app that enables clients to look at potential trainers, and for trainers to link with potential clients. The app is currently set up to link the two by means of availability (morning, afternoon, or evening). The future direction of the app would be to link the two by means of availability and current zip code location.
